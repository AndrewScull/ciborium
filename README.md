# ciborium

Welcome to Ciborium!

Ciborium contains CBOR serialization and deserialization implementations for serde.

## Quick Start

You're probably looking for [de::from_reader](de/fn.from_reader.html) and
[ser::into_writer](ser/fn.into_writer.html), which are the main functions.

For dynamic CBOR value creation/inspection, see [value::Value](value/enum.Value.html).
